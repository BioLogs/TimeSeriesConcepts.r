# Time Series Concepts

This repository is mainly focused on providing *time series* examples, concepts and general
analysis of them in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

All documents are writen in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) markup language and converted to HTML files to be served as part of this website.

Although the initial chapters use a mix of base R functions and those of 
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), 
I'll try to stick to the latter because of its design principles and 
simply how easy it is to use and understand. In addition, I'll be 
exploring and using [tidyverts](https://tidyverts.org/), a project that
seems to follow the same design principles and philosophy as the **tidyverse**
but with a special focus on time series.
